#
#SITE_QW_ID USGS Station Identifier for water-quality sampling
#SITE_FLOW_ID USGS Station Identifier for streamflow measurement
#CONSTIT Abbreviation indicating constituent type.  Values include "FLOW", streamflow; NH3, ammonia as N; NO23, nitrate plus nitrite as N; OP, orthophosphate as P; SI, silica as SiO2; SSC, suspended-sediment concentration; TN, total nitrogen as N; TP, total phosphorus as P
#WY Water year
#MODTYPE The type of model used to compute load values.  Values include "COMP", indicating the composite method; "DAILY", indicated data were computed using daily values (SSC only); "NONE", indicating no model was used (FLOW only); "REG", indicating models were computed using regression methods described in the technical information portion of the website; "REG_3", indicating models were computed using regression methods described in the technical information portion of the website but with a 3-year moving window as opposed to a 5-year moving window; "REG_PRELIM", indicating that a model was developed using data collecting during the initial 2-4 years in which a site was sampled, models at these sites will continue to be updated until 5-years of data are collected; "REG_PRELIM_FINAL", indicating that the model was developed using data collecting during the first 2-4 years in which water-quality data were collected, but that sampling concluded and the initial model was not able to be updated
#TONS Load, in tons
#TONS_L95 Lower 95% confidence interval of the water-quality load, in tons
#TONS_U95 Upper 95% confidence interval of the water-quality load, in tons
#FWC Annual flow-weighted concentrations, in milligrams per liter
#MEAN_C  Mean annual concentration, in milligrams per liter, note that this value is blank if samples are not collected at least quarterly during the specified water year
#YIELD  Yield, in tons per square mile
